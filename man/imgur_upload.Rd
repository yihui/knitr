\title{Upload an image to imgur.com}
\usage{
imgur_upload(file, key = "9f3460e67f308f6")
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{the path to the image file to be uploaded}

  \item{key}{the client id for Imgur (by default uses a
  client id registered by Yihui Xie)}
}
\value{
  A character string of the link to the image; this string
  carries an attribute named \code{XML} which is a list
  converted from the response XML file; see Imgur API in
  the references.
}
\description{
  This function uses the \pkg{RCurl} package to upload a
  image to \url{imgur.com}, and parses the XML response to
  a list with \pkg{XML} which contains information about
  the image in the Imgur website.
}
\details{
  When the output format from \code{\link{knit}()} is HTML
  or Markdown, this function can be used to upload local
  image files to Imgur, e.g. set the package option
  \code{opts_knit$get(upload.fun = imgur_upload)}, so the
  output document is completely self-contained, i.e. it
  does not need external image files any more, and it is
  ready to be published online.
}
\note{
  Please register your own Imgur application to get your
  client id; you can certainly use mine, but this id is in
  the public domain so everyone has access to all images
  associated to it.

\examples{
f = tempfile(fileext = ".png")
png(f)
plot(rnorm(100), main = R.version.string)
dev.off()
\dontrun{
res = imgur_upload(f)
res  # link to original URL of the image
attr(res, "XML")  # all information
if (interactive()) 
    browseURL(res)

## to use your own key
opts_knit$set(upload.fun = function(file) imgur_upload(file, key = "your imgur key"))
