\title{Specify the parent document of child documents}
\usage{
set_parent(parent)
}
\arguments{
\item{parent}{path to the parent document (relative to the current child
document)}
}
\value{
The preamble is extracted and stored to be used later when the
  complete output is written.
}
\description{
This function extracts the LaTeX preamble of the parent document to use for
the child document, so that the child document can be compiled as an
individual document.
}
\details{
When the preamble of the parent document also contains code chunks and inline
R code, they will be evaluated as if they were in this child document. For
examples, when \pkg{knitr} hooks or other options are set in the preamble of
the parent document, it will apply to the child document as well.
}
\note{
Obviously this function is only useful when the output format is LaTeX.
  This function only works when the child document is compiled in a
  standalone mode using \code{\link{knit}()} (instead of being called in
  \code{\link{knit_child}()}); when the parent document is compiled, this
  function in the child document will be ignored.

## can use, e.g. \\Sexpr{set_parent('parent_doc.Rnw')} or
