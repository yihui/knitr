\description{
Options for R code chunks. When running R code, the object \code{opts_chunk}
(default options) is not modified by chunk headers (local chunk options are
merged with default options), whereas \code{opts_current} (current options)
changes with different chunk headers and it always reflects the options for
the current chunk.
}
\details{
Normally we set up the global options once in the first code chunk in a
document using \code{opts_chunk$set()}, so that all \emph{latter} chunks will
use these options. Note the global options set in one chunk will not affect
the options in this chunk itself, and that is why we often need to set global
options in a separate chunk.

See \code{str(knitr::opts_chunk$get())} for a list of default chunk options.
}
\note{
\code{opts_current} should be treated as read-only and you are supposed
  to only query its values via \code{opts_current$get()}. Technically you
  could also call \code{opts_current$set()} to change the values, but you are
  not recommended to do so unless you understand the consequences.
