\title{A general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation in R}
\description{
This is an alternative tool to Sweave with a more flexible design and new
features like caching and finer control of graphics. It is not limited to LaTeX
and is ready to be customized to process other file formats. See the package
website in the references for more information and examples.
}
\note{
The pronunciation of \pkg{knitr} is similar to \emph{neater} (neater
  than what?) or you can think of \emph{knitter} (but it is \emph{single t}).
  The name comes from \code{knit} + \code{R} (while \code{Sweave} = \code{S}
  + \code{weave}).
