#' Generate BibTeX bibliography databases for R packages
#'
#' This function uses \code{\link[utils]{citation}} and
#' \code{\link[utils]{toBibtex}} to create bib entries for R packages and write
#' them in a file. Only the auto-generated citations are included for a package.
#' This function can facilitate the auto-generation of bibliography databases
#' for R packages, and it is easy to regenerate all the citations after updating
#' R packages.
#'
#' The citation is forced to be generated from the DESCRIPTION file of the
#' package, the keyword \samp{R-pkgname} is used for the bib item where
#' \samp{pkgname} is the name of the package.
#' @param x package names (packages which are not installed are ignored)
#' @param file the (\file{.bib}) file to write (by default writes to the R
#'   console; ignored if it is \code{NULL})
#' @param tweak whether to fix some known problems in the citations, especially
#'   non-standard format of authors
#' @param prefix a prefix string for keys in BibTeX entries; by default, it is
#'   \samp{R-} unless \code{\link{option}('knitr.bib.prefix')} has been set to
#'   another string
#' @return a list containing the citations (also written to the \code{file} as a
#'   side effect)
#' @note Some packages on CRAN do not have standard bib entries, which was once
#'   reported by Michael Friendly at
#'   \url{https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2010-November/058977.html}. I
#'   find this a real pain, and there are no easy solutions except contacting
#'   package authors to modify their DESCRIPTION files. Anyway, the argument
#'   \code{tweak} has provided ugly hacks to deal with packages which are known
#'   to be non-standard in terms of the format of citations; \code{tweak = TRUE}
#'   is by no means intended to hide or modify the original citation
#'   information. It is just due to the loose requirements on package authors
#'   for the DESCRIPTION file. On one hand, I apologize if it really mangles the
#'   information about certain packages; on the other, I strongly recommend
#'   package authors to consider the \samp{Authors@@R} field (see the manual
#'   \emph{Writing R Extensions}) to make it easier for other people to cite R
#'   packages. See \code{knitr:::.tweak.bib} for details of tweaks. Also note
#'   this is subject to future changes since R packages are being updated.
