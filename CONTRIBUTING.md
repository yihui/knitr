For very simple changes such as fixing typos, you can just edit the file by
clicking the button `Edit` after you open the file online. For more complicated
changes, you will have to manually create a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) (PR) after
[forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository.

To make sure you did not break anything, you need to run tests, which are
done through the [**testit**](http://cran.rstudio.com/package=testit)
package. If you added any features, add your own tests in `tests/testit/`.

If you are lazy or do not understand what I said above, just push commits to
your repo, submit a PR, wait for a few minutes, then take a look at the
`Commits` panel -- if you see green check marks ✔ on your commits, you are fine.
[Travis CI](http://yihui.name/en/2013/04/travis-ci-general-purpose/) will run
the tests automatically for me. If your pull request passes the tests, you see
green check marks, otherwise you see red crosses, and you will probably get
email notifications as well.

- [An example PR that passed the
  check](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/pull/852/commits)
- [An example PR that failed](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/pull/832/commits)

When your PR does not pass the check, you need to click on the red cross to see
details. There are two sets of tests: `R CMD check` on the package source, as
well as the test on examples. The former is basically the unit tests, and the
latter is to make sure your changes does not break my existing examples in the
[knitr-examples](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples).

If your changes involve the roxygen2 documentation, please _do not_ include the
changes under the `man/` directory, which are generated by `roxygenize()`. I
will run `roxygenize()` by myself after I merge your PR. You should keep the
changes in your PR minimal by excluding the roxygen2 artifacts from your GIT
commits, so it will be easier for me to review your PR.

For a non-trivial fix or feature implementation, please let me know before you
start working on it, since I do not want to waste too much of your time on
something that I do not really want.

Thanks, and happy hacking.
