Since LyX 2.0.3, **knitr** can be used in LyX via a module named `Rnw (knitr)`. See [knitr.lyx](https://github.com/yihui/lyx/raw/master/examples/knitr.lyx) for a simple example ([pdf output](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/lyx/knitr.pdf)). Just add the module to your document and install **knitr** in R; then you are done.

An important note to all LyX users: a big trouble with LyX+Sweave is that we have got too many instructions in the past on how to configure LyX in order to work with Sweave. Now you probably should ignore all of them; many tutorials are becoming misleading and confusing (e.g. you no longer need to take care of `noweb.sty`). The only up-to-date source is the [official LyX manual for Sweave](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/lyx/sweave.pdf).

## Ubuntu users

To install LyX, you can either check out the source code and compile it by yourself:

{% highlight bash %}
./authgen.sh
./configure
make
make install
{% endhighlight %}

or use the [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~lyx-devel/+archive/release) (much easier):

{% highlight bash %}
add-apt-repository ppa:lyx-devel/release
{% endhighlight %}

The one in the official repository is often lagging behind, and this PPA is up-to-date.

## Other systems

If you use Windows or Mac OS, you can download LyX from <http://www.lyx.org>.

## Other languages

If you are under Windows and using multibyte characters, you may need to tweak the knitr module as [discussed here](http://yihui.name/knitr/#comment-513794734).

## Other examples

There are a couple of LyX examples under the [examples directory](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/tree/master/inst/examples) of the package repository. Remember to check out the bib files as well if there are any.

Below is a short video of using **knitr** in LyX (no audio at the moment but I plan to make a full tutorial in the future):

## Some known issues

You should not let LyX mark foreign languages, otherwise it may ruin R code chunks; see [#255](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/255) for details. Below are my language preferences in LyX:
