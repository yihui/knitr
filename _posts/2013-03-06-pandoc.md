The function `pandoc()` in **knitr** (since version 1.2) was designed to convert Markdown documents to other formats such as LaTeX/PDF, HTML and Word (odt/docx). The main idea is to minimize the command-line call by wrapping commands into a configuration file or embedded configurations. Normally we call Pandoc via command line like this:

{% highlight bash %}
pandoc -s --mathjax --number-sections --bibliography=foo.bib -o output.html input.md
{% endhighlight %}

It is tedious to type the same command again and again. What `pandoc()` does is to execute the command like above in R via `system()`, but read the Pandoc arguments from a config file, so that we can write all arguments in the file once, and simply call `pandoc('input.md')` afterwards.

Follow the instructions on the [Pandoc website](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to install it, and it will be ready to use.

## Absolute beginners

If you have no experience using the command line, you can try this function without any configurations. Write a Markdown file, say, `foo.md`, and throw it into `pandoc()`:

{% highlight r %}
library(knitr)
pandoc('foo.md', format='html')  # HTML
pandoc('foo.md', format='latex') # LaTeX/PDF
pandoc('foo.md', format='docx')  # MS Word
pandoc('foo.md', format='odt')   # OpenDocument
{% endhighlight %}

But you often need some custom options like what we showed in the beginning. Now we explain how to pass such options to Pandoc.

## A simple example

Suppose you want to convert Markdown to HTML with arguments in the first command line example, you can write a config file like this (`<empty>` here means you should leave this option empty):

{% highlight control %}
format: html
s: <empty>
mathjax: <empty>
number-sections: <empty>
bibliography: foo.bib
o: output.html
{% endhighlight %}

You can save it as `foo.txt` and run

{% highlight r %}
library(knitr)
pandoc('input.md', format='html', config='foo.txt')
{% endhighlight %}

Then **knitr** will parse this config file and turn it into pandoc arguments. The empty options such as `s` and `mathjax` are turned to `-s` and `--mathjax` respectively, and those non-empty options like `bibliography` and `o` are converted to `--bibliography=foo.bib` and `-o output.html` respectively.

## The config file

The config file is essentially a Debian Control File. Here are some rules:

1. the option name and value are separated by `:`
1. an option can have a value of multiple lines but all the following lines have to be indented by white spaces
1. blank lines are used to separate records (paragraphs)

The first rule is simple. For the second rule, consider `bibliography`: when there are multiple bibliography databases to be passed to Pandoc, we can write the config file as

{% highlight control %}
bibliography: paper1.bib
  paper2.bib
  paper3.bib
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, it is converted to `--bibliography=paper1.bib --bibliography=paper3.bib --bibliography=paper3.bib` and passed to Pandoc.

For the third rule, it is useful when we define multiple output formats in the config file; below is an example of two records for `html` and `latex` output:

{% highlight control %}
format: html
s: <empty>
mathjax: <empty>
number-sections: <empty>
bibliography: foo.bib
o: output.html

format: latex
latex-engine: xelatex
s: <empty>
number-sections: <empty>
output: test.pdf
{% endhighlight %}

With this config file, we can call `pandoc('input.md', format='latex', config='foo.txt')` and we will get a PDF file `test.pdf`.

The name of the config file is obtained from `getOption('config.pandoc')` by default, which means you can set `options(config.pandoc = 'path/to/your/config.file')` as a global option. If this option is not set, the `pandoc()` function will look for a file `foo.pandoc` where `foo` is the base name of the input file, e.g. it looks for `test.pandoc` if the input file is `test.md`. In other words, the config file has the same name as the Markdown file except that it has a different extension.

## Common options

Sometimes we want to share some a few common options across different output formats. For instance, `--number-sections` can be used for both PDF and HTML output. The record that does not contain the `format` tag is treated as common options for all formats. Now we can rewrite the above config file as:

{% highlight control %}
s: <empty>
number-sections: <empty>

format: html
mathjax: <empty>
bibliography: foo.bib
o: output.html

format: latex
latex-engine: xelatex
output: test.pdf
{% endhighlight %}

Note the `s` and `number-sections` are extracted to a separate record without a `format` tag.

## Embedded configurations

We may want to make the Markdown file self-contained in the sense that the configurations are embedded in it, so we do not need to rely on an external config file. In this case, we can use a special comment `<!--pandoc -->` in the Markdown file.

{% highlight html %}
<!--pandoc
format: html
s:
mathjax:
number-sections:
bibliography: foo.bib
o: output.html
-->
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can pass a single file to other people and they will be able to call `pandoc()` to convert it to the expected format.

If both the config file and embedded configurations are found, they will be combined as if they were from a single file.
