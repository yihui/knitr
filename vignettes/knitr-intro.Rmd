The **knitr** package [@R-knitr] is an alternative tool to Sweave based on a
different design with more features. This document is not an introduction,
but only serves as a placeholder to guide you to the real manuals, which are
available on the package website <http://yihui.name/knitr>^[e.g. the [main
manual](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/manual/) and the [graphics
manual](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/graphics/)], and remember to read the help pages of
functions in this package. There is a book [@xie2013] for this package, but
it may not be useful to those who prefer digging out information on the web.

Anyway, here is a code chunk that shows you can compile vignettes with
**knitr** as well using R 3.0.x, which supports non-Sweave vignettes:

```{r show-off, tidy=TRUE}
options(digits=4)
rnorm(20)
fit=lm(dist~speed, data=cars)
b=coef(fit)
```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(summary(fit)$coefficients, caption='Regression coefficients.')
```

The fitted regression equation is $Y=`r b[1]`+`r b[2]`x$.

```{r graphics, fig.cap='A scatterplot with a regression line.'}
par(mar=c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 20)
abline(fit, col = 'red')
```
