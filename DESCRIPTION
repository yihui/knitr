Description: This package provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report
    generation in R, which can be used to deal with any type of (plain text)
    files, including Sweave, HTML, Markdown, reStructuredText and AsciiDoc. The
    patterns of code chunks and inline R expressions can be customized. R code
    is evaluated as if it were copied and pasted in an R terminal thanks to the
    evaluate package (e.g. we do not need to explicitly print() plots from
    ggplot2 or lattice). R code can be reformatted by the formatR package so
    that long lines are automatically wrapped, with indent and spaces being
    added, and comments being preserved. A simple caching mechanism is provided
    to cache results from computations for the first time and the computations
    will be skipped the next time. Almost all common graphics devices,
    including those in base R and add-on packages like Cairo, cairoDevice and
    tikzDevice, are built-in with this package and it is straightforward to
    switch between devices without writing any special functions. The width and
    height as well as alignment of plots in the output document can be
    specified in chunk options (the size of plots for graphics devices is still
    supported as usual). Multiple plots can be recorded in a single code chunk,
    and it is also allowed to rearrange plots to the end of a chunk or just
    keep the last plot. Warnings, messages and errors are written in the output
    document by default (can be turned off). Currently LaTeX, HTML, Markdown
    and reST are supported, and other output formats can be supported by hook
    functions. The large collection of hooks in this package makes it possible
    for the user to control almost everything in the R code input and output.
    Hooks can be used either to format the output or to run a specified R code
    fragment before or after a code chunk. The language in code chunks is not
    restricted to R only (there is simple support to Python and Awk, etc). Many
    features are borrowed from or inspired by Sweave, cacheSweave, pgfSweave,
    brew and decumar.
