Description: This package provides a general-purpose tool
    for dynamic report generation in R, which can be used
    to deal with any type of (plain text) files, including
    Sweave and HTML. The patterns of code chunks and inline
    R expressions can be customized. R code is evaluated as
    if it were copied and pasted in an R terminal thanks to
    the evaluate package (e.g. we do not need to explicitly
    print() plots from ggplot2 or lattice). R code can be
    reformatted by the formatR package so that long lines
    are automatically wrapped, with indent and spaces being
    added, and comments being preserved. A simple caching
    mechanism is provided to optionally cache results from
    computations for the first time and the computations
    will be skipped the next time. Almost all common
    graphics devices, including those in base R and add-on
    packages like Cairo, cairoDevice and tikzDevice, are
    built-in with this package and it is straightforward to
    switch between devices without writing any special
    functions. The width and height as well as alignment of
    plots in the output document can be specified in chunk
    options (the size of plots for graphics devices is
    still supported as usual). Multiple plots can be
    recorded in a single code chunk, and it is also allowed
    to rearrange plots to the end of a chunk or just keep
    the last plot. Warnings, messages and errors are
    written in the output document by default (can be
    turned off). Currently LaTeX and HTML are well
    supported, and other output formats can be supported by
    hook functions. The large collection of hooks in this
    package makes it possible for the user to control
    almost everything in the R code input and output. Hooks
    can be used either to format the output or to run a
    specified R code fragment before or after a code chunk.
    Most features are borrowed or inspired by Sweave,
    cacheSweave, pgfSweave, brew and decumar.
