Description: This package provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report
    generation in R, which can be used to deal with any type of (plain text)
    files, including Sweave and HTML. The patterns of code chunks and inline R
    expressions can be customized. R code is evaluated as if it were copied and
    pasted in an R terminal thanks to the evaluate package (e.g. we do not need
    to explicitly print() plots from ggplot2 or lattice). R code can be
    reformatted by the formatR package so that long lines are automatically
    wrapped, with indent and spaces being added, and comments being preserved.
    A simple caching mechanism is provided to cache results from computations
    for the first time and the computations will be skipped the next time.
    Almost all common graphics devices, including those in base R and add-on
    packages like Cairo, cairoDevice and tikzDevice, are built-in with this
    package and it is straightforward to switch between devices without writing
    any special functions. The width and height as well as alignment of plots
    in the output document can be specified in chunk options (the size of plots
    for graphics devices is still supported as usual). Multiple plots can be
    recorded in a single code chunk, and it is also allowed to rearrange plots
    to the end of a chunk or just keep the last plot. Warnings, messages and
    errors are written in the output document by default (can be turned off).
    Currently LaTeX, HTML and Markdown are supported, and other output formats
    can be supported by hook functions. The large collection of hooks in this
    package makes it possible for the user to control almost everything in the
    R code input and output. Hooks can be used either to format the output or
    to run a specified R code fragment before or after a code chunk. Most
    features are borrowed or inspired by Sweave, cacheSweave, pgfSweave, brew
    and decumar.
