Description: This package provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report
    generation in R, which can be used to deal with any type of (plain text)
    files, including Sweave, HTML, Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, and
    Textile. R code is evaluated as if it were copied and pasted in an R
    terminal thanks to the evaluate package (e.g., we do not need to explicitly
    print() plots from ggplot2 or lattice). R code can be reformatted by the
    formatR package so that long lines are automatically wrapped, with indent
    and spaces added, and comments preserved. A simple caching mechanism is
    provided to cache results from computations for the first time and the
    computations will be skipped the next time. Almost all common graphics
    devices, including those in base R and add-on packages like Cairo,
    cairoDevice and tikzDevice, are built-in with this package and it is
    straightforward to switch between devices without writing any special
    functions. The width and height as well as alignment of plots in the output
    document can be specified in chunk options (the size of plots for graphics
    devices is also supported). Multiple plots can be recorded in a single code
    chunk, and it is also allowed to rearrange plots to the end of a chunk or
    just keep the last plot. Warnings, messages and errors are written in the
    output document by default (can be turned off). The large collection of
    hooks in this package makes it possible for the user to control almost
    everything in the R code input and output. Hooks can be used either to
    format the output or to run R code fragments before or after a code chunk.
    The language in code chunks is not restricted to R (there is simple support
    to Python and shell scripts, etc). Many features are borrowed from or
    inspired by Sweave, cacheSweave, pgfSweave, brew and decumar.
