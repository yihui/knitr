			 CHANGES IN knitr VERSION 0.4

NEW FEATURES

  o Sweave concordance was finally implemented: when
  opts_knit$get('concordance') is TRUE, knitr will write a file named
  'input-concordance.tex' which contains the mapping between input Rnw
  and output tex line numbers; this feature is mainly for (but not
  limited to) RStudio to provide better error navigations: you can
  jump from the TeX error message to the Rnw source directly to know
  where the error comes from (the line number of the source of the
  error may not be accurate but should be in the ballpark) (#133)
  (thanks, JJ Allaire and Joe Cheng)

  o if output hooks have been set before calling knit(), they will be
  respected, i.e. knitr will no longer override them by default hooks;
  you need to make sure *all* output hooks are set appropriately,
  e.g. you can start by render_latex() and change some individual
  hooks later (#165) (thanks, Andrew Redd)

  o newly created objects in the global environment will also be
  cached if cache is turned on (cache=TRUE); in previous versions
  knitr is unaware of objects created in globalenv(),
  e.g. setGeneric() creates S4 generic functions in globalenv() and
  knitr was unable to capture them (#138) (thanks, syoh)

  o chunk options dev, fig.ext and dpi can be vectors now; this allows
  one to save a plot to multiple formats, e.g. <<foo, dev=c('pdf',
  'png')>>= creates two files for the same plot: foo.pdf and foo.png
  (#168) (thanks, MYaseen208)

  o an experimental feature for animations created by FFmpeg in
  HTML/markdown output when fig.show='animate' (#166) (thanks,
  gabysbrain)
  
  o the chunk option 'fig.cap' supports multiple figure captions in
  LaTeX now, e.g. if a chunk produces two plots, we can use fig.cap =
  c('first caption', 'second caption') to assign two different
  captions to them respectively when fig.show = 'asis' (#155) (thanks,
  Jonathan Kennel)

  o new package option opts_knit$get('upload.fun') which is a function
  that takes a plot file to upload to a certain host and returns the
  link to the image; by default it is imgur_upload(), and you can use
  your own function to upload images to other hosts like Flickr (#159)
  (thanks, Carl Boettiger)

  o all packages loaded in the current session are also cached, so as
  long as a package has been loaded previously, it will be available
  to all following chunks (#160)

  o new chunk option 'autodep' and function build_dep() to build cache
  dependencies among cached chunks automatically by analyzing object
  names in all cached chunks; this is a loose alternative to the
  'dependson' option (see main manual and ?build_dep for details)
  (#72) (thanks, Seth Falcon)

  o input and output in knit() are no longer restricted to files; they
  can be stdin()/stdout() or other types of connections (#162; see
  https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/162) (thanks, gabysbrain)

  o as-is output (results='asis') and plots are no longer put in the
  framed environments because of incompatibilities (#163) (thanks,
  DCCKC, Murray Logan and Jennym Hutchison)

BUG FIXES

  o for plots in LaTeX output, centering should be done with
  {\centering } instead of \centering{} (#156) (thanks, Ramnath
  Vaidyanathan)

  o the recorded plot is a more precise representation of the expected
  plot now, because the recording device also takes the plot size into
  consideration (#157) (thanks, Christiaan Klijn and Frank Harrell)

  o format_sci() now correctly formats 0; this function is used for
  inline R code to format numbers in scientific notation (#161)
  (thanks, Kihoro J. M.)

  o fixed a bug for the case in which the chunk option only contains
  the label like <<label=foobar>>=; knitr 0.3 was unable to parse the
  label correctly (<<foobar>>= is OK) (thanks, Muhammad Yaseen)

MINOR CHANGES

  o imgur_upload() returns the link to the image directly, with the
  XML list as its attribute (in v0.3 the list was returned)
  
			 CHANGES IN knitr VERSION 0.3

NEW FEATURES

  o a fundamental and important new feature for writing chunk options:
  they can be written as valid R code now, just like we write function
  arguments (e.g. echo=c(1, 3, 5), fig.cap="my figure caption"); all
  options will be parsed and evaluated as R code by default; see
  http://yihui.name/knitr/options for details (#142) (thanks, Baptiste
  Auguie)

  o chunk references using <<label>> is supported now (#86); thanks to
  Kevin R. Coombe and Terry Therneau for the discussion

  o new function run_chunk() to run the code in a specified chunk,
  which is an alternative to the chunk reference in Sweave; see
  http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/reference/

  o a executable script 'knit' under system.files('bin', package =
  'knitr') which makes it easier to call knitr via command line under
  *nix (call 'knit input [output] [--pdf]')

  o the inline hooks respect getOption('digits') and
  getOption('scipen') now (see ?options); numbers returned from inline
  R code will be formatted according to these two options (see a demo
  at http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/output/)

  o if you still use old Sweave syntax for chunk options, it is
  possible to write literal commas in chunk options now -- they have
  to be escaped by \, e.g. caption=hello\, world; this will be parsed
  to 'hello, world' as a character string; of course this looks ugly
  and has limited power, so please please consider the new syntax!

  o knit2pdf() gained another argument 'compiler' which can be used to
  specify the program to compile the tex document to PDF, such as
  xelatex (#131) (thanks, Ramnath Vaidyanathan and Dennis Murphy)

  o a new function imgur_upload() to upload images to imgur.com; it
  can be used in HTML or Markdown hooks so the output is a
  self-contained document which does not need additional image files;
  opts_knit$get('upload') controls whether to upload images
  automatically (#66)

  o a child document can be compiled individually with the LaTeX
  preamble borrowed automatically from a parent document using a new
  function set_parent(); see the help page for details (#136) (thanks,
  Helder Correia)

  o to avoid $$ around numbers in the inline output, we can use I() to
  protect the numeric inline output, e.g. $x = \Sexpr{I(10^7)}$ gives
  $x = 10^7$ whereas \Sexpr{10^7} gives $10^7$ (thanks, Kevin
  Middleton)

  o the listings package is formally supported now (see
  ?render_listings); the default style is borrowed from Sweavel.sty
  written by Frank Harrell (#101) (thanks, Frank)

  o new package option 'cache.extra' which allows more objects to
  affect cache; see http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/cache/ (#134)

  o new package option 'child.path' to specify the search path of
  child documents relative to the parent document (#141)

  o new package option 'aliases' to set aliases for chunk options; see
  http://yihui.name/knitr/options (#144)

  o new chunk options 'fig.cap', 'fig.scap' and 'fig.lp' to write
  captions, short captions, label prefix for the figure environment in
  LaTeX (#145) (thanks, Frank Harrell)

  o new package option 'eval.after' to set a character vector of chunk
  options which should be evaluated _after_ a chunk is executed
  (thanks, Frank Harrell)

  o a series of convenience functions pat_rnw(), pat_tex(), pat_brew()
  and pat_html() to set built-in patterns (syntax) to read input

MINOR CHANGES

  o package option 'eval.opts' has been dropped: all options of
  classes 'symbol' or 'language' will be evaluated, so there is no
  need to specify which options to evaluate manually; remember, the
  chunk options are similar to function arguments, so you can use any
  valid R code there
  
  o the default value for the 'output' argument in knit() is NULL now,
  so we can also provide output filenames to stitch() and knit2pdf()
  (#119)

  o standard LaTeX messages are suppressed when a tikz plot is
  compiled to PDF so that we can see the knitr process more clearly

  o %\SweaveInput{} will be ignored now (#150)

  o results=asis will no longer affect the 'chunk' hook (in the past,
  the chunk output was not wrapped in the kframe environment when
  results=asis); it only affects the 'output' hook now

  o the package website allows comments now

MAJOR CHANGES

  o the starting pattern of normal texts in an Rnw document is
  '^@\\s*%*' instead of '^@\\s*$' now, meaning you can write '@ % a
  comment' to end a code chunk (this is consistent with Sweave)

  o the default value of the argument 'output' of knit() will be a
  filename under the current working directory; in previous versions,
  the output file will be under the same directory as the input file;
  this change makes it possible to completely separate the input files
  and output files into different places, and hopefully will give
  users better experience in managing a whole collection of files
  (including child documents): put all source files in one place and
  output files in another place

  o the package homepage is http://yihui.name/knitr now (the previous
  URL yihui.github.com/knitr will be automatically redirected to the
  new address)

BUG FIXES

  o the object opts_current does not give the evaluated version of the
  current chunk options because it was created before the options are
  evaluated; this has been fixed and opts_current$get() will give the
  expected values of options (thanks, Frank Harrell)

MISC

  o number of downloads (https://github.com/yihui/knitr/downloads) of
  knitr documentation before I removed and updated them on GitHub:
  c(main = 1300, graphics = 549, themes = 130, beamer = 565, listings
  = 240, minimal = 160)

			 CHANGES IN knitr VERSION 0.2

NEW FEATURES

  o added support for including child documents in a main document
  (like \SweaveInput{} but with different implementations); see
  http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/child/ (#92)

  o for inline R code, character results are returned as-is now
  (without \texttt{})

  o new function purl() as a wrapper to knit(..., tangle = TRUE) which
  extracts R code from the input document (thanks to Dieter Menne's
  wife who suggested the function name)

  o the error hook applies to inline R code when an error occurs in
  the inline R code, in which case knitr will not stop by default;
  instead, it writes the error message into the output (#85)

  o chunk option 'split' also works for HTML output now using
  '<iframe></iframe>' (#82)

  o knit() gained an argument `text` as an alternative to 'input'
  (#88)

  o new chunk option 'child' to include child documents into the main
  document (#92)

  o chunk option 'external' defaults to TRUE now (was FALSE by default
  in the last version)

  o added a new demo to show how to build package vignettes with
  knitr: http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/vignette/

  o added support to the quartz() device under Mac (#103); now the
  'dev' option has more choices (see http://yihui.name/knitr/options)

  o chunk option 'echo' can take a numeric vector to select which R
  expressions to echo into the output now (#108); see
  http://yihui.name/knitr/options

  o a new function stitch() which is a convenience function to insert
  an R script into a template and compile (to quickly create a report
  based on an R script)

  o for a chunk hook to run, the corresponding chunk option no longer
  has to be TRUE; it can be any non-null values; this enables us to
  make use of the option value directly instead of only knowing it is
  TRUE (see http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/cache/ for an example)

  o knit() will no longer writes figure or cache files in the same
  directory as the input document; instead, these files are written in
  the current working directory (see ?knit)

  o a new function knit_env() that makes the environment of the
  current chunk accessible to the user

BUG FIXES

  o the code used to merge global chunk options and local options was
  buggy for cache; it has been fixed now, so cache is more stable
  (#105), but users may see previously cached chunks being
  re-evaluated with this version, which should be regarded as a normal
  phenomenon, and on the second run, the cached chunks will not be
  evaluated again

  o fixed a buglet when using both options 'out.width' and
  'out.height' in Rnw (#113)
