# Motivation

In the past years I have been a regular user of the **knitr** package, that allows the generation of high quality $\LaTeX$-based PDF or HTML reports based on simple input files, coded in either $\LaTeX$+R (Sweave) or **markdown**+R (Rmd notebooks).

Jupyter notebooks offer similar functionality of PDF and HTML export, however they are not text but rather json files and require a jupyter notebook server to be edited. I was also missing **knitr**'s simplicity and efficiency for configuring code chunks, and tell which code and/or output should appear in the report, chose the figure size, etc.

**knitr** already had a facility for executing python code, with however no support for multi-chunk session sharing, and no support for image output. Following Yihui's [invitation](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines/) to contribute new engines, I implemented one with improved support for python.

# Implementation

My contribution is based on the standard jupyter messaging interface - the exact same that jupyter notebook use. My code was also inspired by the [VIM plugin for ipython](https://github.com/ivanov/vim-ipython) by Paul Ivanov.

Most of the engine is implemented in the python script [ipython_exec.py](https://github.com/mwouts/knitr/blob/master/inst/ipython/ipython_exec.py) that executes the desired command on the desired kernel, save plots to disk, and prints the resulting $\LaTeX$ or markdown code on the console.

By default, the ipython engine will start a new (python) kernel. You may also want to start you own kernel with
```
jupyter kernelspec list       # list available kernels
jupyter console [--kernel=ir] # start a new (python/[R]) jupyter kernel
```
and connect knitr to that kernel with the chunk option `kernel='existing'`. If you want to connect to other kernels than the last started one, execute 
```
%connect_info
```
in the jupyter console, and set the kernel chunk option to, for instance, `kernel='kernel-55381.json'`.

# Requirements

A modern python installation is required. knitr must be able to find both `python` and `jupyter`. If necessary, update the PATH environment variable.

# Example

We start with a knitr's setup. In practical use cases, you will probably want to set the chunk option `include=FALSE` on this chunk.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
# set global chunk options: images will be 7x5 inches
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=7, fig.height=5)
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(kernel='existing') # uncomment if you want to connect to your own jupyter console
```

Now we show a few python computations. Note that only explicit calls to `print`, plus the last line, lead to some output. Again, the input or output could be removed by using knitr's options `include` and `echo`.

```{ipython computing}
x = 1+1
print(x)
from math import pi
print(pi)
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
np.random.rand(5)
```

Note that the variable `x` defined above is accessible from later chunks, even from inline chunks, with for instance: the value of `x` is `py x`, and 2 &times; &pi; = `py 2*pi`.

Plots are saved to disk in the directory designated by the chunk option `fig.path`. Plots can be postponed after the end of text output with the chunk option `fig.show='hold'`.

```{ipython graphics, fig.show='hold'}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = np.random.rand(20)
plt.hist(y)
plt.show()
y = np.random.rand(20)
plt.hist(y)
plt.show()
```

To compile this document to markdown, and then HTML, either use the **Knit** button in RStudio, or execute

```{bash compile, eval=FALSE}
Rscript -e 'library(knitr); knit("knitr-ipython.Rmd")'
Rscript -e 'library(rmarkdown); markdownToHTML("knitr-ipython.md")'
```

# How to create a Python + markdown notebooks?

Starting a notebook from an empty file is possible, but you probably already have some material.

* If you already have a markdown file: change the extension from `md` to `Rmd`, open the file in rstudio and insert python chunks. Change {python} to {ipython}.
* If you were practicing jupyter notebooks: run the `ipynb2rmd.py` script in `knitr/ipython`, or, equivalently, execute
```
jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to markdown --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True
```
and replace `python` with `{ipython}` in the code chunks.
* Or, open the source file for this document at `knitr/examples/knitr-ipython.Rmd`

# Can I share data between python and R chunks?

Not exactly. Still you can call the ipython engine from R chunks. For instance:

```{r rdata_to_python}
py_exec = function(cmd) knitr:::ipyx(cmd, options = list(kernel = knitr::opts_chunk$get("kernel"), results="asis"), message=FALSE)
x = 17
py_exec(sprintf("x_py=%d", x))
```

```{ipython}
y_py = x_py + 1
y_py
```

```{r python_data_back}
as.integer(py_exec("y_py"))
```
