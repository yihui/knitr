# Test of other languages in knitr

R works, of course.

``` {r test-r, engine='R'}
set.seed(123)
rnorm(5)
```

Can **knitr** deal with other languages? You should have them installed.

## Python

``` {r test-python, engine='python'}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print x
print x.split(' ')
```

## Awk

We need to pass a `file` option to Awk.

``` {r test-awk, engine='awk', file=system.file('examples', 'knitr-manual.Rnw', package = 'knitr')}
# how many non-empty lines?
NF {
  i = i + 1
}
END { print i }
```

## Ruby

``` {r test-ruby, engine='ruby'}
x = 'hello, ruby world!'
p x.split(' ')
```
