\title{Using subfloats in \LyX{} with knitr}


\author{Yihui Xie}

\maketitle
If you insert a float figure inside a float figure in \LyX{}, you
will get subfloats. To make sure the two subfloats can stand side
by side, you have to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item remove new lines between the two subfloat environments in \LyX{} (if
you are not sure if there are blank lines between them, check the
\LaTeX{} source);
\item use the chunk option \texttt{echo=FALSE} to hide the R source code
in the output;
\item set \texttt{out.width} to be less than half of the linewidth if you
do not want the sub figures to exceed the page margin;
\item most importantly, leave a blank line in the beginning of the subfloat
environment, so that \texttt{<\textcompwordmark{}<>\textcompwordmark{}>=}
starts in a new line and \textbf{knitr} can recognize it;
\end{enumerate}
Figure \ref{fig:knitr-subfloat} is an example.
